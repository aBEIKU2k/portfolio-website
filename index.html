            <p> I have known Ernest for 5 years.
              Ernest is a kind, generous, and intelligent person.
              He is always willing to help others, whether it is with a project or simply offering a listening ear.
              He is also a great problem solver and a team player.
              I believe that Ernest would be an asset to any organization.
